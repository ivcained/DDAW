Built with Open Source Technologies.

Producers can create tracks and with a click be able to mint their creations and set royalty in code through Audio NFTs. 

Tech Stack:

GridSound (0.43.1) wants to be an open source online digital audio workstation following the new WebAudio API.

Our 12 Stem+ Sound track that was recorded in Denver.
These Individual Stems will be processed individually and a unique amount of "Sends" also known as the FX such as Delay, Reverb, Pitch Modulation and 50 other unique effects.

On mint, the DDAW will generate a unique NFT by making a mix down and adjusting the Channel Levels and FX Sends and a Master Bus Channel based on the time of mint and wallet address autonomously until 512 NFTs are Minted on Base (OPStack, L2) and Ethereum (L1)

The tracks will be put individually on our own custom version of Helicon: forked from tr666eth/helicon
A library for making music with web audio. 
It was developed as part of the audioglyphs project, but we hope that it will be useful to others working on similar things. (Thank you!)

It aims to use native web audio APIs as directly as possible and to be general purpose - avoiding including any specific audio processing or sequencing code in favor of things that apply to any project and any style of music.
